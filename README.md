# FRENCA_Replicated
Code for implementation of FRENCA (Frozen Encoder) paper

Current Status: Tried to fix the noise issue by using normalized_signal instead of encoded_signal that did not work out
The code does not exactly replicate the paper as the channel coder has only 3 layers compared to 7 from the paper
